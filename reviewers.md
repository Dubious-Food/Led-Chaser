   - Schematic, 1:40:00, (I accidently left lapse running while installing open office. I spent most of this time trying to find the right symbols. I wasn't able to get information via the workshop because the slack app kept crashing while I was in the huddle. Please reduce the time/feathers I get from this period. Sorry)
2. https://lapse.hackclub.com/timelapse/Y8oA7mGrhAQ4

### Disclaimer
I did not intentionally inflate the time it took to create this. This was the first time I've worked on a pcb and the first time I've used lapse. Please reduce feathers/time gained from this project.
